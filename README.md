## how to use
step 1 - download the python file, as well as text file, and place both in same folder. then open a cmd prompt in the folder location, and type `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

step 2 - go to telegram and creat a bot using [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather). copy that api token given by bot and paste it into line 60 in the script, replacing the 
YOUR BOT TOKEN text.

step 3 - get your chat id by going to the [Show Chat ID](https://t.me/show_chat_idbot) bot and starting it. paste that id into line 61 of the code, replacing the YOUR CHAT ID line

step 4 - run the script, and watch the magig happen :)
